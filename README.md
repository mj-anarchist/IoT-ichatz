## Unmanned marine life quality monitoring device (IoT - iChatz) 

> ### Description

This IoT project aims to develop a device which can automatically roam around a certain water area and collect information like sunlight intensity, temperature, humidity, nearby objects like plastic etc. Combining all the data, we would deduce if the water is suitable for the marine life. Sunlight, water temperature, humidity, pollution estimation using capactive sensor and by moving the device from one area to another without any instruction from anyone. We'd need to set the perimeter first and then leave it be. It'll automatically float around and gather data, our custom algorithm with custom scale will grade the water quality for marine life, if we become successful in counting objects like plastic, we can also estimate water pollution of a certain type.
