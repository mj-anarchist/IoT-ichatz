> ### Product Details - Users

Users can purchase this device and leave it in a river or canal. The device will move around that area and get readings. It will send all the data to the cloud where we'll average out the values and provide the user with correct averaged value. The user will be able to see the data after logging into their dashboard, they would have to enter the purchase ID that'll be written inside the packaging of the device or probably on the device itself.

1 - User A i.e. Sara. (Persona + Story)
--
Sara is a 26 years old Phd student doing research work in management sciences. She lives near a lake and she loves the fishes, she gets to see from time to time, swimming around. She knows that sometimes, she won't see any and at times, she can see a lot or even she can catch some too. It's been a month and she hasn't seen even the water move. She's worried and wants to know why she can't see any marine life activity. She uses our product and throws it in the river after powering it on. Once powered on and activated, the device accesses the server, sends the information back to it and she can login to the website with the device ID and can see the water quality and overall marine life quality. She then all gets information as to what can be the potential problem with water if fishes are dissappearing. 

2 - User B i.e Bob (Persona + story)
--
Bob is a fisherman, 38 years old. He's been fishing for nearly 20 years. He also feeds fishes from time to time and loves fishing. He's contributed to the social organization working for ocean pollution. He along with his mates hates overfishing. He notices that the water quality is getting poorer and poorer. Back several years, he would just jump in the water, swim and chill and get back onboard but now when he does the same thing, his skin hurts. He has started itching and his skin burns from time to time. Now he thinks that there's certainly something wrong with water since his friends are also saying/complaining about the same thing. He purchases our device, leaves it be, check the dashboard and notices something strange with the water. Water pollution has increaded and the number of platic objects has increased exponentially. He now goes ahead and prints results and shows the numbers to the people and court and aks them to take proper action.
